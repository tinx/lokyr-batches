# lokyr-batches
Service to manage production and ingredient batches, and their relations.

## Motivation

Lokyr produces beverages. Since these are food, certain rules apply. One of
those rules is to keep track of all ingredients, and to register which batches
they were used for. This information might become vital in a product recall
for whatever reason.

This service is meant to fulfill this function. It can be used to register
batches of ingredients and production batches, and establish a correlation
between those.
